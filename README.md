# S-Process_Binary_Data

## LOCATION HAS BEEN MOVED TO ZENODO, YOU MAY FIND ALL OF YOUR CHEMICALLY PECULIAR STELLAR SPECTRA AND DATA HERE: _____________________________________

Hosting location for stellar spectra, RV data, and abundace data collected through the ChETEC-INFRA TNA program for Alexander J. Dimoff's PhD project in nuclear astrophysics.

Included telescopes / instruments are: Ondrejov OES, Moletai VUES, Rozhen ESpeRo. Raw stellar spectra can be found in the corresonding directories.

RV data and abundance data can be found in the RV_data and Abund_data directories. Collected and measured RV data is one file with columns: star names, HJD, RV (km/s), and RV_err (km/s). 

Abundance data is separated by star. For each star, a file contains the object name, atmospheric parameters, and available abundance information. 

For Example:
